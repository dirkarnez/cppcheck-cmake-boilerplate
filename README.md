[Cppcheck Portable (C/C++ analysis tool) | PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/cppcheck-portable)

### Notes
- Cppcheck should be in `%PATH%`
- Cppcheck does not necessarily need to stop compilation - it performs static (compile-time) analysis on source code. Therefore, the source code should be able to be compiled first.
